# Linear is a purpose-built tool for planning and building products.

Linear helps 10,000+ software teams streamline their entire product development process, from bug and issue tracking all the way to managing project documents, complex initiatives, and long-term roadmaps.

    title: "Why do teams switch to Linear?",
    content: `
Traditional task and project management tools suffer from three core problems:

1. **They are not built for product development**
   - Require hacking together your own DIY workflows
2. **They lack user engagement**
   - Users resist adding and updating tasks
3. **They don’t scale**
   - Break down under compounding complexity

As a result, teams slow down and lose their product velocity. To regain momentum and build with speed and focus again, companies are switching to Linear.

    title: "Linear is specifically built for product teams",
    content: `
Most task and project trackers are created as general-purpose tools ("All-in-one tool for everything"). They offer endless customization options but are unable to deliver any specific high-velocity workflows that modern product development demands.

Linear is different. It is specifically designed and optimized for product and engineering workflows from the ground up.

From planning and building to launching and maintaining, Linear streamlines the entire development cycle. No matter if it’s a simple bug report or a company-wide initiative, every aspect is purpose-built and fluidly integrated, so that teams can move with urgency and focus.

    title: "Linear is optimized for engagement",
    content: `
The key function of any task or project management tool is communication and coordination between people. It doesn’t matter how many features a tool has – if people don’t use it, it fails to be an effective source of truth.

While it’s often overlooked in other tools, we have found that end-user experience really matters. Making Linear fast, simple, and enjoyable to use pulls people in and encourages them to use the tool more frequently. This higher level of engagement translates to better communication and collaboration, which in turn leads to higher quality output from the organization.

Teams that migrate to Linear from tools such as Jira, Shortcut, GitHub Issues, or Asana report significantly higher user engagement.

After switching to Linear:

- **4.5x Increase in active users**
- **2x Increase in reported issues**
- **2x Faster issue closing times**

*Average increase based on data from companies with 50+ employees who switch from another issue tracker to Linear*

    title: "Linear scales with your company",
    content: `
As companies grow, complexity naturally increases. Most tools either can’t handle that complexity or accumulate excess processes through custom hacks and other DIY workarounds that don’t scale and ultimately lead to organizational stagnation.

Linear’s fit-to-purpose design scales from early-stage teams to large enterprises without sacrificing speed and simplicity. For larger teams, switching to Linear feels like a reset: It eliminates unnecessary processes and systematically keeps them streamlined.

Linear is the tool of choice for more than 10,000 organizations, from ambitious startups to major enterprises, including Fortune 20 companies. They choose Linear to accelerate their product momentum and build with speed and focus.

It's never too early or too late to make the switch. Ramp, for example, has been building with Linear for over five years, scaling to 1,000+ employees since. Scale, on the other hand, recently migrated its team to Linear and is already seeing a step-change in product velocity.

Here are a few of the other companies that recently made the switch:

After their transition, teams see significantly more engagement, faster turnaround times, and an increase in the overall quality of their execution:

- **Scale resolves bugs 2x faster since switching to Linear**
- **Pleo saved $30,000 a year by moving to Linear Asks**
- **Remote switched their 1,000 person team to Linear to move faster**
