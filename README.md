Steps:
1. ensure .env file mirrors what's on vercel
2. run `npm i` to install dependencies
3. run `npm run dev` to run locally
4. make changes
5. once you're done, run `npm run build` and if you have created any "build errors" they will be printed in the cli
6. fix the errors (by pasting into the right hand chat bar)
7. push changes to github
